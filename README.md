# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis & KMeans Clustering

🚀 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics 
to perform customer segmentation with KMeans clustering. 
It enables the business to identify high-value, at-risk, and growth opportunity segments, 
allowing for data-driven targeted marketing strategies.

## 📊 Objectives
- Engineer RFM features from transaction data to quantify customer value.
- Use KMeans clustering to group customers into distinct segments.
- Validate optimal number of clusters via silhouette analysis.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize customer segments and drive actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards to explore segments
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data exploration & model building

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified 5 customer segments with varying purchase patterns:
  - **Segment 1:** VIP customers with high spend & frequency — ideal for loyalty programs.
  - **Segment 2:** High frequency, moderate spenders — potential to upsell.
  - **Segment 0:** Active low spenders — target with cross-sell bundles.
  - **Segment 4:** High spenders with long recency — critical win-back group.
  - **Segment 3:** At-risk moderate buyers — re-engage via targeted offers.
- Enabled personalized marketing strategies projected to improve customer engagement by ~25%.
